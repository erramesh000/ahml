Place the attached logo image into the project so the page can display it:

1) Create a folder named `assets` at the project root if it doesn't exist.
2) Save your provided logo image as `assets/logo.png` (or `logo.jpg`) replacing the existing placeholder.

Preview:
- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or right-click -> Open With).

If you prefer, I can embed the logo directly into `index.html` as a base64 data URL so you don't need an external file — tell me if you'd like that.
